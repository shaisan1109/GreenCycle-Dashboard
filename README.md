## GreenCycle Dashboard
This is the repository for the GreenCycle Dashboard project.

### Requirements
* **MySQL version 8.0.41** (Server and Workbench)
  * Note: If your MySQL version is not the same, meaning lower or higher, uninstall MySQL apps via Control Panel > Uninstall a program (Windows) then [download the installer here (first option)](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)
* **Git** - for pushing changes to GitHub
* **Node.js** - for running the website

### Important Files
* **.env file** - not proper to upload it in the net but w/e. This is needed to run the website; add it in the root folder.
* **dump.sql file** - contains the database
* [Download both files here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bESa7PxbPTC2yN1USS02Fkb0mpn81ma9?usp=drive_link)

### Important Commands
* `npm run dev` - run nodemon this way and you won't have to restart the localhost after changes
