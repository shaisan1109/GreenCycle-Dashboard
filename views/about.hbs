    <h1>Who Are We?</h1>
    <p>{{companyName}} is a Waste Management Company established in 2014 with the mission 
        of helping out Local Government Units to be compliant with RA 9003, also known as the 
        Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000. We help LGUs achieve 26% waste diversion 
        from the landfill through collection efforts by processing and converting waste into a viable energy 
        source or material.</p>
    <p>{{companyName}} has also been closely working and collaborating 
        with companies since 2018 in their Plastic Neutrality Programs in response to RA 11898, 
        better known as the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) Law. Companies that carry various brands 
        are now required to reduce their plastic footprint by recovering a percentage of their plastic packaging 
        waste every year from the environment.</p>
